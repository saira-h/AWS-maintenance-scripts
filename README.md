# EC2Cleanup

This script cleans up AMIs and EC2s depending on a removal date in a "RemoveOn" tag that your resources must have. This will be in the format DD-MM-YYYY.

# DeleteSnapshots

This script deletes snapshots with no AMI attached.

Both of these scripts can be configured to run as often as needed via timed CloudWatch event triggers on EventBridge.

## Usage

Change the regions and AWS Account number, and copy paste into Lambda console.
